----

The Managed GitOps Backend-Shared is a group of libraries shared among the rest of the components.

It consists of the following exported Go packages:

- [Operation API]: used by the [GitOps Operation Controller] of the [Cluster-Agent] component.
- [Database functions and structs]: interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- [Service Account]: creates a service account on the remote cluster.
- [Proxy Client]: a simple utility function/struct that may be used to write unit tests that mock the K8s client.
- [Find an ArgoCD Instance]: functions responsible to return an available ArgoCD instance.

It has the following manifests (`YAML`):

- [Operation CRD]: required for the [GitOps Operation Controller].

## Development

There is nothing to `go build` here.
These are Go packages imported by the other components of the monorepo.

You can do:

```shell
make manifests generate
make lint
make gosec
```

### To run unit tests:

This component is **not** meant to be tested in isolation, but it requires the rest of the monorepo components.

Triggering `make test` it's _probably_ going to **fail** unless you have the required environment up and running.
To do this, please refer to [monorepo README] to find more information about it.
