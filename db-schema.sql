--     - This is what the user would initially provide via the Service/Web UI/CLI
--     - There may be (likely is) a better way of doing this, but this works for now.
-- 2) ServiceAccount state: A bearer token for a service account on the target cluster
--     - Same mechanism Argo CD users for accessing remote clusters

Schema Design Guidelines:

- All primary keys (PKs) should include the name of the table, in the field name.
    - Example:
	    - initial field name: infcluster_id
		- table: GitopsEngineCluster
		- field name is thus: gitopsenginecluster_infcluster_id  
		    - (eg [table]_[initial file name])
	- Why? This makes it easy to track usage of the PK, and refactor at a later date. 
    - Foreign keys (FKs) to PKs do NOT need to include the table name

- No other tables should use a field with the same name as the PK of another table.
	- Why? This makes it easy to track usage of the PK, and refactor at a later date. 

- Use UUIDs for table PK, rather than seqids:
	- Why? Unlike seqids:
	    - UUIDS do not leak information on # of users
		- UUIDs are not vulnerable to increment by one attacks
		- Allows the contents of two RDBMS databases to be easily merged (no need to fix all the seqids)
		- Give flexibility over underlying database store (Other RDBMS-es, other DB technologies)
		- Prevents accidental erasure of table rows (collisions between uuids is much less likely than between integers)

- Name case:
    - For tables: CamelCase
    - For fields: lowercase_snake_case

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Foreign key relationships between tables, as of this writing:
(Tables entries must be deleted in this order, from top to bottom, and created in reverse order)
