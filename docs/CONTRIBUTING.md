# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. Here are a few ways you can help us improve.

## Open an Issue

If you see something you'd like changed, but aren't sure how to change it, submit an issue describing what you'd like to see.

Please create an issue with as much detail as you can provide. It should include the data gathered as indicated above, along with:

1. How to reproduce the problem
2. What the correct behavior should be
3. What the actual behavior is

We will do our very best to help you.

## Submit a Pull Request

If you find something you'd like to fix that's obviously broken, create a branch, commit your code, and submit a pull request.
Here's how:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub, and then clone it locally.
2. Create a branch named appropriately for the change you are going to make.
3. Make your code change.
4. If you are creating a function, please add a tests for it if possible.
5. Push your code change up to your forked repo.
6. Open a Pull Request to merge your changes to this repo. The comment box will be filled in automatically via a template.
7. All Pull Requests will be subject to Linting checks. Please make sure that your code complies and fix any warnings that arise. These are Checks that appear at the bottom of your Pull Request.
8. All Pull requests are subject to Testing. 

> Note, that we use `golangci-lint` to catch lint errors, and we require all contributors to install and use it.
