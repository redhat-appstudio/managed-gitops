# Development

**NOTE**: If developing within your local development environment, it is likely easier to call `make start`, which will automatically build and run the components from the CLI, using *goreman*. 
- This should make building and running the components (iteratively) much faster, than building using `make build`.

## Build the components


Use either the main Makefile or the Makefile of each individual component (you can also call those from the main Makefile as well).
See the following _build_ targets:

```shell
make build                                         # Build all the components
USERNAME=(your quay.io username) make docker-build # Build docker image
```

### Support for multiple platforms

The `make` targets can be configured to build for other operating systems and/or architectures,
by explicitly setting the `OS` and `ARCH` environment variables.

```shell
OS=linux ARCH=amd64 make build      # Build all components for platform linux/amd64
OS=linux ARCH=arm64 make build      # Build all components for platform linux/arm64
```
```shell
OS=darwin ARCH=amd64 make build     # Build all components for platform darwin/amd64
OS=darwin ARCH=arm64 make build     # Build all components for platform darwin/arm64
```

## Build container images

The project uses just one single base image (e.g. `quay.io/redhat-appstudio/gitops-service`), from which one can select which binary you would like to run.

The Dockerfile basically clones the repository and builds each individual component using that component's Makefile.
The final binaries are then copied into `/usr/local/bin`, which is where they are run within the container.

### Build and push: using docker/podman

You may use docker or podman to build the containers. 
- To use podman, pass `DOCKER=podman` on the `make` calls. 
- For example: `USERNAME=(your quay.io username) DOCKER=podman make docker-build docker-push`

```shell
# Login to the contaier registry (e.g. quay.io)
# (or use podman to login)
docker login quay.io

# Optional:
# You can override the name with provide your own username, image name, and tag
# by adding the 'IMG' variable: IMG=quay.io/USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG
# By default, the name would be 'gitops-service:latest' (defined in the Makefile)
# ----
# The IMG variable consists of other variables, such as:
#  * by adding 'USERNAME' variable you need to be logged into your registry.
#  * by adding 'BASE_IMAGE' variable you can change only the name of the image.
#  * by adding 'TAG' variable you can change only the version tag of the image

# Build the container
USERNAME=(your quay.io username) make docker-build

# Push to registry
USERNAME=(your quay.io username) make docker-push

# Or combine them
USERNAME=(your quay.io username) make docker-build docker-push 

# Other optional variables
make docker-build BASE_IMAGE="foo" TAG="bar"
```

### Run the containers

```shell
docker run --rm -it gitops-service:latest gitops-service-backend
docker run --rm -it gitops-service:latest gitops-service-cluster-agent
```

or if you need to debug the image:

```shell
docker run --rm -it gitops-service:latest # to get /bin/bash
```
