The Managed GitOps Database Migration component is responsible for making sure that the database can be versioned UP and DOWN according to the need.

## Getting started with database migrations for manged-gitops

## How are migrations applied? 

- Whenever you need to make changes to the currently applied schema, in the migrations folder, run `make migration-script {filename}`
- A new version of migration will be created. Once the changes are written and verified.
- Make sure to write a rollback script in the `__.down.sql` file. Otherwise, the rollback of migrations won't be possible.
- To apply the latest version of the migration, simply execute `make migrate`
- For additional utilities, for eg: drop the entire db, simply pass drop as a runtime argument like `make db-drop`
- **DO NOT** drop the `schema_migrations` table as that will lead to migration failure.
