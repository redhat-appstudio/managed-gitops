# Install

This workflow will install the two operators, [Backend] and [Cluster-Agent], by pulling their container images from the container registry respectively.
Thus, to deploy them into Kubernetes, make sure you have _already build and push_ the container image to your registry.
For example: `make docker-build docker-push IMG=quay.io/pgeorgia/gitops-service:latest`

As soon as you have a container image into your registry, you are ready to deploy the backend controller:
Given your `kube-config` is already pointing to your Kubernetes cluster, then do:

```bash
make install-all-k8s IMG=quay.io/pgeorgia/gitops-service:latest # replace the IMG var with yours
```

This will automatically install all the required components into your Kubernetes cluster, in the `gitops` namespace.
Notice that, the [Cluster-Agent] operator requires the `argocd` namespace which will also be created as well.

```shell
$ kubectl -n gitops get all

For local development, it's not practical to _push_ to the registry everytime you want to locally test your changes.
If this is your intention, then please follow the [development workflow](./development.md).

## Uninstall

To uninstall it completely, make sure you do not run any other important resources inside the `gitops` namespace, and then do:

```shell
make uninstall-all-k8s
```

This will remove everything the previous command installed, and finally it will also delete the `gitops` and `argocd` namespaces as well.

## Individual components

If you want to install or uninstall individual components, you can also do it by their individual makefile targets.
Notice that for every _deploy_ target you have to specify the `IMG` var or the `BASE_IMAGE` and `TAG` alternatively.

```makefile
deploy-backend                 Deploy backend operator into Kubernetes
undeploy-backend               Undeploy cluster-agent from Kubernetes
```

```makefile
deploy-cluster-agent           Deploy cluster-agent operator into Kubernetes
undeploy-cluster-agent         Undeploy cluster-agent from Kubernetes
```

```makefile
deploy-postgresql              Deploy postgres into Kubernetes
undeploy-postgresql            Undeploy postgres from Kubernetes
```
